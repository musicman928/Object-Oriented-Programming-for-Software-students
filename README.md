# Hello

My name is Thomas Ellsworth. I am currently a student at Southwest Technical College in Cedar City, Utah, studying Software Development.

This repository will store all of my school assignments.

I grew up in Las Vegas and in middle school, I had a programming class. I was immediately facinated and wanted to learn more. This is why I chose this course.

I would like to eventually get a job in this field. I will also use the knowledge from this class to work on my own personal projects and learn other programming languages as well.
